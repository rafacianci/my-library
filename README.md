For this project, I used ReactJS, with Redux.

I used the React CLI to create the project boilerplate to be the fastest way to create and deploy a new project.

For deploy, I'm using the Heroku with Automatic deploy, when there are new commits on master.

And in this project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Install all the necessary dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm test:integration`

Launches the integration test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
#### `To use this command make sure the app is running in development mode`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
